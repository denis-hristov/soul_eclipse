        <p>
          Every print in Soul Eclipse starts as a feeling, a moment or a question.
          The designs are made from dots, just like your story is made from many small moments.

            <h2>Soul Eclipse</h2>
            <p class="story-tagline">The moment when light and shadow meet in the same person.</p>
            <p>
              The Soul Eclipse design shows a face that is half in light and half in shadow when viewed from far away.
              Up close, the face is built from a field of dots that never fully connect. It is a reminder that you can
              carry doubt and still move forward, that you can feel broken and still show up for the people you love.
            </p>
            <p>
              This piece is for those who feel like they are always holding two sides together. The strong and calm
              version that the world sees, and the softer, insecure version that only a few people know. Both sides
              are real, both belong on the same canvas.

            <h2>Broken Halo</h2>
            <p class="story-tagline">Looking perfect on the outside, rebuilding inside.</p>
            <p>
              Broken Halo is built around a simple symbol. A circle that should be perfect, but is cracked in several
              places. From a distance it looks like a clean halo. Up close the cracks are visible and intentional.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design stands for loyalty and love that comes with pressure. For the person who tries to be the
              perfect partner, friend or child, while quietly thinking they are not good enough. The halo is not
              there to show that you are flawless. It is there to show that even cracked, your effort has value.

            <h2>Inner Orbit</h2>
            <p class="story-tagline">Your own gravity, no matter how loud the outside world gets.</p>
            <p>
              Inner Orbit shows a set of circles that sometimes look like planets, sometimes like eyes. The dots flow
              in rings around an empty center. There is no clear sun, no fixed point to follow, and that is the point.
            </p>
            <p>
              This design is about building your own rules and routines when the world feels chaotic. About finding
              a quiet orbit where you can move, grow and fail in your own way. Even when people expect you to spin
              around their plans, you still have the right to be the center of your own small universe.

            <h2>Shattered Light</h2>
            <p class="story-tagline">Light does not disappear, it just breaks into pieces.</p>
            <p>
              Shattered Light looks like a beam of light that has been split into fragments. From far away it feels
              like a simple shape. From close you see that each piece is a cluster of dots, separated but still aligned.
            </p>
            <p>
              This piece is for the moments when you feel like you lost your spark. It says that the light is still
              there, only scattered. You are allowed to take time to gather the pieces. You are allowed to shine
              differently than before.

        <h2>Why dots</h2>
        <p>
          Dots are the smallest visible points in our prints, just like small choices are the points that draw your
          life.
          From far away you see the final shape. Up close you see that nothing is perfectly filled. There is always
          space
          to breathe, to change and to grow.
